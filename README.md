## Overview
​
Our 1st week challenge.

### The challenge
​
I was given a broken HTML and CSS code and brought it up to accessibility standards. I changed non-semantic to semantic elements (e.g. nav, section, article, aside) and moved code to follow a more logical structure and positioning. I added in the alt attributes to the images and then made sure that the heading attributes were all in the correct order. Last I changed the title to the the name of the comapany.
